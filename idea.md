Text Classification using LSTM | Python, Pandas, PyTorch
 January 2025– April 2025
 • Developed a deep learning pipeline using PyTorch and a custom LSTM model to classify IMDB movie reviews as
 positive or negative
 • Performed text preprocessing with torchtext including tokenization, vocabulary building, and padding; integrated
 GloVe embeddings to enhance model performance
 • Designed a neural network architecture by stacking embedding, recurrent, and fully connected layers to improve
 accuracy and generalization
 • Achieved 92% accuracy in sentiment classifion  and improved model performance by 15% through architectural and embedding enhancement
